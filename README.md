# polychrom example with chromospyce
Polychrom example usage lifted from: [open2c_vignettes](https://github.com/open2c/open2c_vignettes)

I'm using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) to make installing of dependencies
easier.

Get started:
1. install pixi
    - probably via `curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash`
2. run `pixi run lab`
    - It'll probably take a while the first time, should be way faster for
    consecutive runs

Other commands:
- `pixi run nbclear`: clears output and `execution_count` fields in ipynb (for
pushing to github)
